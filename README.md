Finance Calculator made using python.


1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want                      
to do. The first output that the user sees when the program runs                          
should look like this : 
 
 
How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the                      
program proceeds. I.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’,                
‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. should all be recognised as valid                  
entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate                          
error message. 
 
2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:  
■ Ask the user to input: 
● The amount of money that they are depositing. 
● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number                  
of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry                    
about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user                      
should enter 8 and not 8%. 
● The number of years they plan on investing for. 
● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple”                    
or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable                  
called interest. Depending on whether they typed              
“simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate            
amount that they will get after the given period at the                      
interest rate. Look below in “Interest formulae” for the                  
formulae to be used. 

3. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: 
■ Ask the user to input: 
● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000 
● The interest rate. E.g. 7 
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the                      
bond. E.g. 120
